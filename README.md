# Microservice user management

I am tired of having to rewrite the user management component for every CRUD based service ðŸ˜ !

So I made this microservice to reuse in future projects.

## Usage

It's not read for producition yet, but you can run a local version:

- Clone this repository and in your terminal run (with mocked kafka producer): `lein with-profile test run`
- If you want to check unit and integrations test run: `lein with-profile test test`
- If you want to see the coverage test report run (with mocked kafka producer): `lein with-profile test cloverage`
